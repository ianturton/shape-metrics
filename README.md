# shape-metrics
This is some code I developed when I lived in the USA and thought that it would be possible to fix their broken electoral system
by helping out with redistricting using machine algorithms such as ZDes that I worked on in the 1990s with Stan Openshaw and others
at the University of Leeds' Centre for Computational Geography.

However reading [Mark Monmonier's "Bushmanders and Bullwinkles"][1] led me to realise that Americans like their system. So I never really finished it up.
When Google Code closed I was reminded of it's existence and moved it to GitHub and converted it from GeoTools 2.6.x to 12.2 (surprisingly easy).
